<h1> Hi ðŸ‘‹, my name is <i>Jaroslaw Mielcarek</i></h1>
<h2>And this is my story..</h2>

<p>Once upon a time, my journey commenced as a network technician, wholeheartedly dedicating my initial four years of my career in this domain. During this period, I had the privilege of serving two esteemed companies, where I polished my skills in creating, maintaining, and expanding both cable/fibre and wireless networks.

As fate would have it, a remarkable opportunity beckoned to create a business venture with my beloved family. The allure of this new chapter led me to the United Kingdom, where I not only improved my English language but also delved into the complexity of running a successful business.

Feeling contented with our accomplishments, I found myself drawn to the enchanting allure of another part of Europeâ€”the sun-kissed lands of Spain. Eager to immerse myself in the rich tapestry of Spanish culture and language, I embarked on a period of exploration and learning.

Yet, as the days unfolded, I came to a profound realisationâ€”it was time to return to my passion in the IT sector. Recently, an enticing opportunity presented itself, allowing me to venture into the captivating realm of game testing. I discovered an undeniable thrill in the challenges it offered, and realised that I am inclined to revisit activities that once brought me great satisfaction. Additionally, a dear old friend, who has shared a similar educational journey with me, has persuasively suggested that I should rejuvenate and enhance my knowledge in the field of software development.

Here I am, in the process of establishing my presence in this realm. So, if there is anything in which I can be useful, please do not hesitate to reach out to me.</p>
